    "In gradient based bigram model, instead of explicitly counting co-occurrence of bigrams, we will randomly initialze those counts and use gradient descent to fill the counts automatically. The gradient will descent according to negative log likelihood loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action plan:\n",
    "1. Read the data and construct input, output for the neural net which will look something like following:\n",
    "    -   names = ['juho', ...]\n",
    "    -   `Xs = ['<s>', 'j', 'u', 'h', 'o', ...]` \n",
    "    -   `Ys = ['j', 'u', 'h', 'o', '<e>', ...]`\n",
    "    -   then use `c2i` to map each character into an int\n",
    "    -   The reason is that we want to feed in a neural net a previous character and expect the model to output the next character.\n",
    "2. Create a weight matrix that will resemble probability matrix in the orginal bigram model.\n",
    "    -   It will be a matrix of shape `V x V` where `V` is our character space.\n",
    "    -   `V[i,j]` can be interpreted as the prob. of `i2c[i]` preceding `i2c[j]`\n",
    "    -    To do so, we need to define:\n",
    "           1. appropriate shape of the matrix\n",
    "           2. appropriate functions to be applied so that we get probability distribution in each row of the matrix,\n",
    "           3. and an appropriate loss function to compare the resulting prob. distribution to the real distribution.\n",
    "    -   The model output would be something like `[0.05 0.65 0.30]` where the reference is `[0, 1, 0]`"
